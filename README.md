# Anonymous Message Board - 5chan

This is a single-page anonymous message board app. It's like 4chan, but without the offensive content that seems to inevitably come along with anonymous internet posting.
I used Express with a PostgreSQL database for the backend, and only vanilla ES6 for the front. I decided not to use a front-end framework in an effort to get back to the basics.

Features include:

* Users can anonymously create posts.
* Users can anonymously comment on posts.
* Users can upload images for posts and comments.
* Mods can delete posts and comments.
