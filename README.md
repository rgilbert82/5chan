# Anonymous Message Board - 5chan

This is a single-page anonymous message board app. It is based on 4chan, but without the terrible terrible content. I used Express with a PostgreSQL database for the backend, and only vanilla ES6 for the front.

Features include:

* Users can anonymously create posts.
* Users can anonymously comment on posts.
* Users can upload images for posts and comments.
* Mods can delete posts and comments.
